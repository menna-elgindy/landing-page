# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is a multi-section landing page project. This project was built on udacity classroom starter code. Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. We will be demonstrating this with the navigation menu. Additionally, dynamically building the navigation is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This project consists of three main files : HTML file ,CSS file and javascript file

- **HTML file** :
	
	Contains four sections that will be displayed on the web page 

- **CSS file** :
	
	Contains different classes and styles of the web page which was created by udacity classroom
	

- **javascript file** :
	
	Contains three main functions:

	 - **buildMenu function** : This function is used to dynamically create a navigation menu based on the sections 

	   of the page

	 - **setActiveSection function** : While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport

	   /closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections. So this 

	   function was created to add active class to the section in the viewport

	 - **scrollToSection function** : Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the 

	   page.
